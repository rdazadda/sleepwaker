# sleepwaker

Invert sleep periods to wake periods from accelerometry data in
particular Actigraph Data.

## Why?

When analyzing 24-hour accelerometry data, sleep periods inflate
sedentary time estimates and using others measures by Actilife software
did not prove real good. **sleepwaker** solves this by converting sleep
periods to wake periods, enabling analysis of waking behavior only by
using this in the subject log diary to restrict the analysis on wake
periods.

## Installation

``` r
# Install from GitHub
devtools::install_github("rdazadda/sleepwaker")
```

## Quick Example

``` r
library(sleepwaker)
library(readr)

# Load ActiGraph batch sleep export
data <- read_csv("BatchSleepExportDetails.csv")

# Convert sleep to wake periods
wake_periods <- sleepwaker(data, 
                           input.type = "raw", 
                           output.type = "wake")
```

## Features

- **One-step processing** from batch export to wake periods
- **Works with** Cole-Kripke and Sadeh algorithms
- **Handles multiple subjects** automatically
- **Export directly** to CSV for analysis
