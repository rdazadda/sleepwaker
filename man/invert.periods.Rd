\title{Invert Sleep and Wake Periods}
\usage{
invert.periods(subject.log, period.type = "sleep")
}
\arguments{
\item{subject.log}{Data frame with columns 'Subject Name', 'On Date', 'On Time',
'Off Date', 'Off Time', and 'Category'}

\item{period.type}{Character string: "sleep" or "wake" indicating input data type}
}
\value{
Data frame with inverted periods in same format as input. Output contains
one fewer period per subject as the final period cannot be inverted without a
subsequent period
}
\description{
Converts sleep periods to wake periods or vice versa by pairing consecutive
periods. The end time of period N becomes the start time of the inverted period,
and the start time of period N+1 becomes the end time, creating complement
periods between consecutive sleep or wake episodes.
}
\details{
The inversion algorithm or method processes each subject independently, sorting periods
chronologically before pairing consecutive entries. Subjects with fewer than
2 periods are skipped with a warning.

Converting wake to sleep is permitted but generates a warning as it results in
compounded data loss.
