Description: Processes batch sleep export data from accelerometry devices and 
    inverts sleep periods to wake periods. Uses output from validated sleep 
    detection algorithms (Cole-Kripke (Adult), Sadeh (Youth)) to create wake periods, 
    which enable researchers to constrain physical activity analysis to waking hours 
    only. This prevents artificial inflation of sedentary time estimates by 
    excluding sleep from behavioral assessments. Provides automated workflow for 
    large-scale accelerometry studies.
