# sleepwaker: Detect Sleep and Wake Periods from Accelerometry Data

Processes batch sleep export data from accelerometry devices and inverts
sleep periods to wake periods. Uses output from validated sleep
detection algorithms (Cole-Kripke (Adult), Sadeh (Youth)) to create wake
periods, which enable researchers to constrain physical activity
analysis to waking hours only. This prevents artificial inflation of
sedentary time estimates by excluding sleep from behavioral assessments.
Provides automated workflow for large-scale accelerometry studies.
